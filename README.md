## üßæ Abstract

This project presents the design and simulation of a **5-stage CMOS ring oscillator** using **Cadence Virtuoso**. The oscillator is built with five inverter stages connected in a loop to generate a periodic output without an external clock. The objective is to analyze the delay, frequency, and stability of oscillations through transistor-level simulations and parametric analysis. The project aims to contribute toward understanding the timing behavior and performance of ring oscillators, which are widely used in clock generation and delay circuits in VLSI design.

## 1. Introduction

A ring oscillator is a simple, yet essential building block in digital and analog circuits. It consists of an odd number of inverter stages connected in a feedback loop. The delay introduced by each stage contributes to the total oscillation period. Ring oscillators are often used for on-chip clock generation, PVT (process-voltage-temperature) monitoring, and performance characterization in VLSI circuits.

This project focuses on implementing a **5-stage ring oscillator**, extending the conventional 3-stage design to study the effects of increased delay and its impact on oscillation frequency.

## 2. Background

Ring oscillators rely on the principle that an odd number of inverters in a loop will produce an unstable system, resulting in continuous transitions ‚Äî essentially forming a square wave oscillator. The oscillation frequency is primarily determined by:

- Number of inverter stages (N)
- Propagation delay of each stage (tp)

The fundamental frequency of a ring oscillator can be estimated as:


Increasing the number of stages or the delay per stage decreases the oscillation frequency. Cadence Virtuoso allows for detailed modeling of this behavior using CMOS transistor-level schematics and simulation tools.

The design was implemented and simulated using the following steps:

- **CMOS Inverter Design:** A standard CMOS inverter was designed using nMOS and pMOS transistors with typical W/L ratios.
- **5-Stage Ring Configuration:** Five such inverters were connected in series with the output of the fifth stage fed back to the input of the first.
- **Biasing and Power:** The circuit was powered using VDD = 1.8V, with all inverter stages uniformly biased.
- **Transient Simulation:** The output waveform was captured over time to observe stable oscillation.
- **Parametric Analysis:** Delay and load variations were introduced to observe their effect on frequency.

Tools used:
- **Cadence Virtuoso Schematic Editor**
- **Analog Design Environment (ADE) for simulation**

- **Transient analysis is employed to see the time-domain output of the ring oscillator. In this 5-stage CMOS ring oscillator, the transient response illustrates a periodic oscillation due to propagation delay across every inverter stage. When simulated, the output waveform illustrates a stable and repeatable oscillation, which confirms the self-sustaining characteristic of the ring oscillator.

As observed in the simulation result, the output voltage alternates between high and low levels with a regular period. This verifies the intended operation of the ring oscillator, in which the feedback loop makes the signal invert and move continuously, resulting in an oscillating waveform. The frequency of oscillation relies on the number of stages and the delay per stage, depending on the load capacitance and transistor size.

The temporary plot indicates definite periodic waveforms for the delay through each of the 5 inverters within the loop, and the waveform remains consistent with time.

Parametric analysis is useful in investigating how the frequency of the oscillator changes with variations in certain parameters in this instance, load capacitance. Through sweeping the value of a capacitor to the oscillator circuit, the analysis demonstrates how rising capacitance impacts the oscillation frequency.

Through the simulation, we can see that:

The oscillation frequency reduces as capacitance increases, owing to increased delay introduced per stage.

The waveform gets slower as the capacitor size increases, and it shows the load capacitance/oscillation frequency inverse relationship in a very clear manner.

Analysis of this sort is important for oscillator frequency tuning for a particular application or for determining how process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations could impact the design.

The parametric simulation graphs a family of waveforms, each for a different value of capacitance. Increasing the capacitance reduces the frequency of the waveforms, showing the direct effect of load on timing behavior.

## 5. Conclusion

The design and simulation of a **5-stage CMOS ring oscillator** were successfully completed using Cadence Virtuoso. Compared to simpler 3-stage oscillators, the 5-stage configuration offers deeper insights into timing behavior and allows fine-grained frequency tuning. The results confirm the theoretical relationship between delay, number of stages, and frequency, validating the design‚Äôs correctness and stability.

This implementation can serve as a foundation for further exploration in VLSI clock generation, delay-based sensors, and frequency calibration techniques.
